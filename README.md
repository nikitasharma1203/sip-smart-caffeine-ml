## Background

This project originated as a **B.Sc. (Hons.) Statistics thesis** at **The Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda** titled:

> **The ABC Insights: Analyzing Brewed Chai Coffee Caffeine**

The original group thesis focused on:

- Survey design and questionnaire development
- Stratified sampling
- Chemical assays for caffeine estimation
- Classical statistical analysis

I later extended the project independently to transform the research into an analytics application by developing:

- Machine learning pipelines
- Predictive models
- PCA and clustering analyses
- Outlier detection
- An interactive Streamlit caffeine calculator

Most recently, I extended the findings a third time — out of the lab and into a product concept — by designing **The Nudge Café**, a pitch for a café that reads a customer's mood and motive on entry and matches them to a seating zone, ambience, and menu built around it.

## Phase 1 — Statistical Analysis

### Sample Design

| Metric | Value |
|-------|------:|
| Pilot Study | 30 respondents |
| Estimated Proportion | 0.70 |
| Required Sample Size | 298 |
| Final Sample Size | **320** |
| Population Size | 3,829 students |

Sampling was performed using a stratified design based on academic year.

### Reliability

Cronbach's alpha was computed on the behavioral survey items after excluding demographic variables.

- One behavioral sub-scale showed acceptable internal consistency.
- Another showed very weak consistency, representing a limitation of the survey instrument.
- Overall reliability was reported in the thesis as acceptable, though findings should be interpreted cautiously.

### Caffeine Content Verification

Instead of relying solely on self-reported consumption, caffeine concentrations were experimentally estimated using **iodometric back-titration assays** on beverages from popular campus vendors including:

- Nescafé
- K.G. Patel
- Dwarkesh
- Other local brands

These laboratory measurements were later integrated into the Streamlit calculator.

### Key Findings

| Research Question | Test Used | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Regular vs Exam Intake | Wilcoxon Rank Sum | Exam-day consumption significantly higher |
| Sleep vs Intake | Kruskal-Wallis + Jonckheere-Terpstra | Higher caffeine associated with shorter sleep |
| Focus vs Intake | Jonckheere-Terpstra | Significant positive trend during exams |
| CGPA vs Exam Intake | Jonckheere-Terpstra | Positive association |
| Gender vs Intake | Wilcoxon Rank Sum | Significant difference on regular days |

The CGPA-caffeine relationship is associative rather than causal and may reflect self-selection effects.

## Phase 2 — Machine Learning Pipeline

The machine learning pipeline was developed independently using the cleaned survey dataset (`analysis.csv`, n = 320).

### Performance Summary

| Task | Best Model | Metric |
|------|-----------|-------|
| Regression | Linear Regression | R² = **0.752** |
| Classification | Linear SVM | Accuracy = **69.8%** |
| PCA | 2 Components | 43.4% Variance Retained |
| Clustering | K-Means (k=5) | Silhouette Score = **0.521** |
| Outlier Detection | Z-Score & IQR | 11 and 31 observations flagged |

### Regression

Predicted exam-day caffeine intake using:

- Regular tea consumption
- Regular coffee consumption
- Chocolate intake
- Spending habits

**Results**

- R² = 0.752
- MAE = 0.59 cups/day
- Regular tea consumption was the strongest predictor.

### Classification

Students were categorized into four balanced intake groups:

- Very Low
- Low
- Medium
- High

Models evaluated:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- Support Vector Machine
- KNN
- Naive Bayes
- XGBoost

The best-performing model was a **Linear SVM**:

- Test Accuracy = 69.8%
- Train Accuracy = 70.5%
- Minimal overfitting

### Principal Component Analysis

Reduced six beverage consumption variables into two principal components.

| Component | Variance Explained |
|------|------:|
| PC1 | 23.6% |
| PC2 | 19.8% |
| Total | **43.4%** |

The modest variance retention suggests beverage preferences are inherently multi-dimensional.

### K-Means Clustering

Applied K-Means clustering using:

- Regular caffeine intake
- Exam-day intake
- Spending behavior

**Silhouette Score**

```text
0.521
```

Five behavioral groups emerged:

- Light consumers
- Moderate consumers
- Exam-driven spenders
- High habitual consumers
- High-intake fixed-spend consumers

The smallest clusters should be interpreted cautiously due to their limited sample sizes.

### Outlier Detection

Two approaches were used:

| Method | Outliers |
|------|------:|
| Z-Score (>3σ) | 11 |
| IQR Method | 31 |

Outliers primarily reflected unusually large changes in caffeine spending during examination periods.

## Streamlit Application

The project includes an interactive caffeine intake tracker built using Streamlit.

### Features

- Brand-specific caffeine estimates derived from laboratory assays
- Serving-size based intake calculation
- Weight-based intake thresholds
- Sleep and focus tracking
- Session history and undo support
- Rule-based wellness alerts

The application uses session state to enable live recalculation as drinks are added or removed.

## Phase 3 — The Nudge Café (Concept Extension)

A third extension of this project, moving the findings from analysis into a product concept: **The Nudge Café**, a pitch for a café that asks a customer how they're doing before seating them, then matches them to one of four zones — Focus, Gather, Date, or Calm — each with its own seating shape, color palette, and menu.

The concept is a direct application of two findings from Phase 1: that mood and motive states (exam stress, sleep debt, social context) measurably shift consumption behavior, and that environmental design (color, seating shape, pattern) is known to shift arousal and behavior in turn. The Nudge Café combines both into a single check-in-to-seating flow.


### The four zones

| Zone | Seating | Ambience | Menu |
|------|---------|----------|------|
| Focus | Long communal tables, upright chairs | Bold color, near-silent | Espresso, cold brew, black filter |
| Gather | Round tables, bubbly cluster chairs | Warm tones, upbeat playlist | Sharing platters, coolers |
| Date | Small two-seaters, set close | Dim warm light, dusty rose | Affogato, dessert pairings |
| Calm | Deep lounge seating, swirl pattern | Muted sage, soft diffuse light | Herbal tea, decaf, turmeric milk |

This phase is a concept and design exercise rather than a deployed product — no live venue, transaction data, or user testing exists yet.

## Limitations

- Findings are based on students from a single university and are not nationally representative.
- Caffeine consumption is self-reported.
- Statistical and machine learning analyses identify associations rather than causal relationships.
- Classification and clustering results should be treated as exploratory due to the modest sample size.
- Chemical assays estimated caffeine concentration by brand rather than individual consumption.
- The Nudge Café is a design concept validated against Phase 1 findings only; it has not been tested with real customers or a physical pilot.
